# Requesting an Azure Sandbox Subscription

This document outlines the process for requesting an Azure sandbox subscription for testing and development purposes.

## What is an Azure Sandbox Subscription?

An Azure sandbox subscription is an isolated Azure environment that allows you to experiment with Azure services without affecting production resources or incurring significant costs. There are minimal guard rails and you will have broad permissions within your subscription.

## Eligibility
* All full-time employees involved in Azure-related projects
* Contractors with approval from their manager
* Interns working on Azure-based assignments

## Request Process

1. **Prepare Required Information**
   - Your full name and employee ID
   - Department and project name
   - Justification for the sandbox (e.g., testing new service, proof of concept)
   - Estimated duration of use
   - Required budget if expected to be in excess of $100/mo

2. **Submit Request**
   - Log into our ServiceNow portal: [https://snow.acmecorp.com](https://snow.acmecorp.com)
   - Navigate to "Cloud Services" > "Azure Sandbox Request"
   - Fill out the request form with the information prepared in step 1
   - Click "Submit Request"

3. **Approval Process**
   - Your request will be reviewed by the platform team
   - You may be contacted for additional information
   - Typical approval time is 2-3 business days

4. **Access Your Sandbox**
   - If approved, you'll receive an email with:
     - Azure subscription ID

## Usage Guidelines

- The sandbox is for non-production use only

- The sandbox will be automatically deprovisioned after the approved duration
- All data and resources in the sandbox will be deleted upon deprovisioning
- Extend your sandbox by submitting a new request at least 1 week before expiration
